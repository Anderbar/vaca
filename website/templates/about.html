    <p>Sometimes you just need to get away and go on vacation. Well we totally get it and that's why we designed Vaca.com! If you are looking to just get out and know what amount of money you are willing to spend, then Vaca.com is the perfect website.<br>        You just need to input your budget, starting location, and dates you wish to travel. You also get the option to give us a radius to search from and the rating you want the hotel to have.<br> If you have no preference, then our algorithm will search
        for locations within the U.S. and will not restrict any hotel options. Our website will display multiple options that fit the requirements. With each destination, you will also get information about the hotel, transportation, and attractions nearby.

    <p>Our group formed in the Summer of 2022 at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a common goal: to have the ability to find affordable vacation options! <br> Here are each of our introductions: <br> <br></p>
    <p>My name is Andrew Franco, and I'm a Computer Science Major at RPI in the Class of 2024. Having a tool that finds good vacation options at a decent price is definitely a plus for me. <br> Personally, I'm very indecisive, so the fact that this website
        gives you random vacation options from anywhere is my favorite feature about Vaca.com!</p>
    <br>
    <p>My name is Ananya Yadav and I am a business analytics major from RPI Class of 2024. As a frequent traveler, I know our product can be extremely useful. <br> I often want to get out and go somewhere but have no clue where. Vaca.com can give potential
        options all while staying within your budget!</p>

        your budget.</p>
